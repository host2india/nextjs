## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000/blog or http://localhost:3000/dashboard in your browser to see the result.

Open http://localhost:3000 to navigate Authentication Models.

You can start editing the page by modifying the files in the pages directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API Routes
API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/protected.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Font Optimization
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load the Inter font.
